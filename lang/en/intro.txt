This plugin allows you to clean up the history.

It deletes all page revisions that have been made by the same user within a one-hour timeframe.

**Clean on recent changes:**

When this option is selected, only the pages contained in the list of the most
recent changes are checked.

**Clean on namespace:**

This option will check all pages within (and below) the given namespace.
If no namespace is entered all namespaces will be checked.

Use this with caution, it can take a long time.
